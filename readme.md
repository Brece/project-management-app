# Project Management Application
This is a small full-stack (CRUD) project management system with **GraphQL, Express, MongoDB, React, and Apollo**.
My goal with this project was to learn the basics of GraphQL.
**Features:**
    Create/Delete User
    Create/Update/Delete Project
    Allocate projects to a user
    Delete a user and all associated projects will also be deleted
    Live update with refetching queries or updating the cache

### GraphQL endpoint:
    http://localhost:PORT/graphql

### Start Backend Server (in root folder)
```
npm run dev
```

### Start Frontend (in Client Folder)
```
npm run start
```
